\section{Working experience}
\cventry{2023}{Data science intern}{Quantco}{}{Zürich}{Worked on improving Quantco's open source Python package for estimating generalized linear models (\href{https://github.com/Quantco/glum}{glum}). Added a formula interface, flexible Wald tests, and other quality-of-life features. Refactored the package serving as its backend (\href{https://github.com/Quantco/tabmat}{tabmat}) to have a more consistent interface. My work during this internship forms the basis of the \href{https://github.com/Quantco/glum/releases/tag/v3.0.0}{glum v3} and \href{https://github.com/Quantco/tabmat/releases/tag/4.0.0}{tabmat v4} releases.}
\cventry{2018--2019}{Analyst}{National Bank of Hungary}{Directorate Financial Analysis}{}{Constructed an IFRS9-compliant model of credit risk for the stress-test of the financial system. Estimated a disequilibrium model of financial constraints. Worked on modeling the effect of EU subsidies on financial constraints.}
\cventry{2016--2018}{Junior analyst}{National Bank of Hungary}{Directorate Financial Analysis}{}{Estimated the efficacy and effectiveness of EU subsidies. Estimated and ran satellite models for the stress-test of the financial system.}
